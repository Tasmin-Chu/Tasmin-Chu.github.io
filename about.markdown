My name is Tasmin Chu. I'm a mathematics student at McGill University. 

I'm interested in the intersections between category theory, probability, and analysis. Previously I studied descriptive set theory in McGill's Directed Reading Program. Right now, I'm learning category theory from the excellent Professor Prakash Panangaden.
