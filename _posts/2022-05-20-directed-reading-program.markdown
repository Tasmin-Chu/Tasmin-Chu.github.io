On Apr 29th of this year, I gave my first mathematics talk! This is something I had never done before, but miraculously, I think it went pretty okay. 

In the talk I discuss a particular class of games called Gale-Stewart games, which are infinite games with two players and perfect information. Surprisingly, these games aren't just relevant to game theorists. They can be used to answer and frame certain interesting analytic problems that pertain to descriptive set theory. As it turns out, infinite games with a Borel payoff set are "determined" - meaning there always exists a winning strategy. But, as I show in this talk, in general that result doesn't hold...
